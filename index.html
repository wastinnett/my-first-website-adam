<h1>hello</h1>
<p>hi yourself. this is the first website that can be viewed to the entire world.
  keep working with this code to get used to saving and uploading new code.
<em>this text is additional text for the first website.</em></p>

<p> <h2>Example 1:</h2>
  We will begin with plain text, easily visible in any browser.
Browsers generally take text and apply formatting rules to it.
This is precisely what we will be doing in the next example.</p>

<p><h2>Example 2:</h2>
  <!-- These are comments. They don't show up in the browser window but give us information on the content of the page. Developers leave notes for each other in the comments. -->
<!-- Here we introduce HTML HyperText Markup Language -->
<!-- The "markup" part means that we can change the appearance of the page -->
<!-- We will get to the HyperText part later-->
<h3> Examples of Formatted Text </h3>
<!-- Here is a header tag. Notice how the text encapsulated by header taggs becomes a larger page heading  -->
<!-- Nearly all HTML tags use <tag_name> </tag_name> syntax -->
<!-- never ever ever forget the forward slash on the second tag -->
  Here are some examples of text formatting using html tags.
  Later on you will see more <em>sophisticated formatting</em> with css but
  is a good start.
</p>
<h3> There are other </h3>
<h4> header sizes </h4>
  You can google them :)
</p>

<p><h2>Example 3:</h2>
  <em>Look at the tab. It should read "My First Real Webpage"</em></p>
